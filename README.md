## how do we apply this?
The regular patient in [MyDoctor](https://emergencylevel.herokuapp.com/MyDoctor): The User can add the doctor he wants, he can read the information about the doctors that he has in his profile, he can eliminate any doctor from his list.

Then when the user creates, the user creates her account in our application and also when she creates a ticket for the waiting shift in the emergency room.
