    <h5>cut the waiting time</h5>
    <p>We have developed a method that allows us to shorten the waiting time in the emergency room, you can get your
      waiting number from your cell phone while you are on the way.

      Our virtual clinic offers hands-on care for basic illnesses and common conditions you may experience, such as the
      common cold, sore throat, conjunctivitis, rash, urinary tract infection, and more.</p>

    <h5>Pregnant women should receive the right care at the right time.
    </h5>
    <p>     The WHO recommends that pregnant women see their healthcare provider at least eight times during pregnancy to
      detect and treat potential problems and reduce the likelihood of prenatal or neonatal mortality. Prenatal care
      also offers an opportunity for health personnel to provide support and information to pregnant women, for example
      on healthy lifestyles, disease prevention and family planning</p>

    <h5>When consumers choose health care</h5>
    <p><img class="responsive-img" src="{{url_for('static', filename = 'img/carePatient.jpg')}}"></p>
    <p>   they have very little information about the results that affect them. How long will they be away from work? Will
      my pain be well controlled? What are the chances of getting an infection if this doctor operates on me? If
      consumers had as much information about healthcare as they do about consumer products, we would see significant
      improvements in quality â€” and a reduction in costs. If consumers, employers, and insurers had access to this data,
      perhaps we would begin to reduce inequalities and variations in the quality of services provided by different
      health care organizations. When you buy a plane ticket, does it ever occur to you to check how safe the airline
      is? No, since security is guaranteed. The airline industry has instituted safety practices to make all airlines
      safe. You choose your ticket for the price or the service. This is how it should be done with health services.
      Part of this is being transparent about what we are doing well and where we are failing.</p>
